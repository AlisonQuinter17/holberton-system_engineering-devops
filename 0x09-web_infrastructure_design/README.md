# Web Infrastructure Design

## Simple web stack
A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack, so design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start having a user wanting to access your website.

### This simple design contains:
- 1 server
- 1 web server (Nginx)
- 1 application server
- 1 application files (your code base)
- 1 database (MySQL)
- 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
